# Evolve.js

Evolve.js is a lightweight genetics library modeled on Mendelian principles. When implemented, it can enable any self-replicating javaScript object instance to produce child instances whose quantifiable variables are treated as genes. Sequential replication iterations are subject to the laws of Mendelian inheritance, gene mutation, and, if environmental selection pressures are applied, in time, evolution.
