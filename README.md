# DNA.js

DNA.js is a lightweight genetics library modeled on principles of Mendelian genetics. When implemented, it enables any self-replicating javaScript object instance to produce child instances whose quantifiable variables are treated as genes. Sequential replication iterations are subject the laws of Mendelian inheritance, gene mutation, and, if subject to environmental pressure and enough time, evolution.
